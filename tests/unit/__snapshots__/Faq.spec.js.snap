  <h2>
    How is beta computed?
  </h2>
  <paragraph-stub
    text="Monthly excess returns (actual returns in excess of the risk-free return)
      are computed for each share as well as for each of the proxy indices.
      Risk-free rates of return are computed from the JSE’s nominal swap yield
      curve, by rolling an overnight investment over the respective return
      period. If, however, a share has not been traded at a respective
      month-end, the aforementioned returns are computed between last and
      previous trade dates - this is the thin trading adjustment. If one were to
      plot these points with the index’s returns on the horizontal axis and the
      share’s returns on the vertical axis, beta would be the
      slope of the line that best fits these points."

    Annual to monthly standard deviation/volatility?
  </h2>
  <p>
     The standard deviations (or volatilities) provided in the tables in the accompanying Excel workbook are calculated on a monthly basis, and then annualised. Hence, a standard deviation of 48.5% should be interpreted as 48.5% per annum. To convert this into monthly terms, simply divide the published figure by the square root of 12, i.e. (48.5%) /
